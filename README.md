## Description

Based on your task requirement, I have created a custom endpoint url and listed the users and in addition to that, I have also listed specific user's comments/posts (Additional features) using Api.

This is the custom endpoint url : https://mydomain.com/user-list.


## API Reference

I did get the user list from the following api references (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Features

   * I have shown the dropdown in the following link https://mydomain.com/user-list.
   * By default, we are displaying the user lists and once you change the value in dropdown then the result will be shown at this link (https://mydomain.com/user-list) based on the dropdown value you selected.
   * And if you click on any of the features like username / name/id, e.t.c then it will show the corresponding user details without a page load.
   * I have shown all the result data in the table formats and used css styles to design the tables.
   * You can overwrite/edit the plugin functions using hooks.
   * You can create the same template name in theme folder and then you can overwrite/edit the plugin template.

## Testing    

   * I checked my work done with the latest version of the wordpess and it does work in all the versions.
   * I tested with the PHP CodeSniffer and passed/Cleared the errors.
   * I then tested with the unit test and passed as well.
